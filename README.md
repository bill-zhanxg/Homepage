Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the source code for my homepage, which is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The majority of the CSS is handled by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/). I have partnered with Stripe for payment handling. You can access the website at <https://bill-zhanxg.com>!

If you have any suggestions or notice any bugs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
